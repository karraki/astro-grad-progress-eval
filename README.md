# Expectations for Student Progress
## Explicit student expectations for astronomy graduate students in the final years of their PhD programs

This repo includes:
* Progress Evaluation (LaTeX and PDF files)
* Pizza Lunch Checklist (LaTeX and PDF files)
* README: My rationale for creating the Progress Evaluation form 


### General
Individual astronomy departments have varying amounts of requirements for their graduate students. However, there appears to be a lack of formal requirements towards the end of one's degree in many programs.

Regardless of formal requirements, incorporating more communication between advisors and their students after exams and thesis proposals would be extremely helpful for departments to achieve their goals of timely student degree completion.

The progress evaluation document is aimed to assist students who have finished their courses and exams and spend the majority of their time doing research (in general third year students and above). The goal of the document is to keep students on track towards graduation and accountable for their progress. Additionally, and very importantly, it should act to improve advisor-student communications and relationships. This document is intended to facilitate a structured forum for advisors to communicate their thoughts on the student's progress directly to the student. This will allow advisors and students to work together to construct reasonable goals and timelines. Finally, this will force students and advisors to continually re-evaluate goals and timelines in order to ensure timely graduation. This will act as a concrete reality check of reasonableness of timeline.


### Purpose
The purpose of the progress evaluation and checklist is to:
* Encourage on-time student graduation (via timeline evaluation and regular required progress evaluations)
* Provide common set of meeting agenda items for all students
* Help faculty track student progress as required each year by the graduate school
* Facilitate student communication with advisor and committee
* Keep committee up to date to the student's research
* Have students learn to self-evaluate of progress and skills
* Provides structure for post-requirement years of PhD work
* Avoid duplication of effort by having standard documents department wide
* Create official avenue to bring up student or advisor concern on annual basis


### Timeline of Events
Suggested upper year student guidelines:
* Annual meeting with student and advisor
    - A meeting for just the student and advisor focused on current progress and future directions.
    - Done on the student-advisor schedule ~6 months between committee meetings.
    - Address topics listed on "Meeting Checklist" document.
    - Spend significant time on the details of current student progress, advice for improvement, and seriously address timeline revisions.
    - Change the amount of structure, documentation, and timeline discussion to fit the needs of each student-advisor pair.
    - The documentation will be kept by the student (and advisor if desired), making the meeting more flexible (i.e. done a little at a time over regular meetings or all at once).
* Research talk for post-thesis proposal students to update everyone on student's research progress. (Once per year just before committee meeting)
    - This could be in the form of a Pizza Lunch, seminar or group meeting presentation.
    - All NMSU astronomy department committee members should be in attendance. If attendance is not possible please discuss recent research progress outside of the annual committee meeting.
* Annual meeting with student, advisor, and committee members
    - Meeting is focused on current progress and future directions. (Once per year ~1 year after thesis proposal or final requirement)
    - Address topics listed on "Meeting Checklist" document.
    - This meeting should occur within 1 month of research talk with the committee. As the committee should have recently discussed the details of the student's research, this meeting should focus on big picture items instead of minute details of the student's research.

An example astronomy graduate student progression at New Mexico State University would be:
1st year: Classes and ongoing cumulative exams
2nd year: Classes and ongoing cumulative exams
3rd year: Fall: Classwork oral exam, Spring: Thesis proposal
4th year: Fall: Student-advisor meeting, Spring: Pizza lunch talk and committee meeting
5th year: Fall: Student-advisor meeting, Spring: Defense


###Final Thoughts
The goal of a PhD program should be to produce independent researchers and this probably contributes to why required structure disappears in the later years of PhD programs. However, even in industry employees have annual or more often evaluations. Feedback is important to growing as a person and improving as a researcher. Having students work on their self-evaluation skills will help them later down the road when they have no advisor to guide them.

Many of these ideas came from discussions with PhD recipients from New Mexico State University who felt their graduate student experience would have been improved by more concrete guidelines in their final years.

The progress evaluation document should be seen as flexible enough to meet each student-advisor relationship's needs. If you and your student/advisor already do many of the things I am presenting and are listed in the checklist then awesome! I hope this makes you more aware of how much important stuff you are doing and what a good relationship you have with your student/advisor. If some of these things were not immediately obvious, please consider that they may be helpful to you.
